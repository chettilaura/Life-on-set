## Description
Life On Set is a virtual adventure in which you can live the set through the eyes of the runner while learning the basics of the several jobs related to the film world. 

The runner is in charge of helping the workers on the set by accomplishing all the tasks assigned to him: assisting the costume designer, aiding the sound technician or supporting the assistant director in the searching for the appropriate extras. 

This is an exciting experience discovering the astonishing world of film making.

This project was created for the Virtual Reality course at Politecnico di Torino.
